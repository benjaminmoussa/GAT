Novskov details what was found in Berlin, the difficulties encountered, and some of the methods used to overcome the stubborn German defense. For the battle of Berlin, the Russians organized combined assault detachments, consisting of one tank battalion, a rifle battalion, a company or platoon of engineers, a battalion of artillery (not less than 122-millimeter), and a platoon of flame throwers. Fundamentally, the defense of Berlin was based on three defensive belts, with intermediate strongpoints: the outer ring of defense along the line of lakes and canals: the ring of defense in the outskirts and suburbs; and an inner ring in the city proper. The Germans had expected the assault to be made from the East and had concentrated their defenses in that area. Soviet tank units, however, attacked from the south, cutting off the Berlin garrison from the southern German armies which were to have constituted its defense in that sector. The attack in the southern sector moved swiftly, with the Soviets by-passing the main centers of resistance and driving quickly through the outskirts and into the suburbs.

From the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 until the Iranian Revolution and the fall of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1979, Israel and Iran maintained close ties. Iran was the second Muslim-majority country to recognize Israel as a sovereign nation after Turkey.[2][3] In the mid-20th century, Israel ran extensive foreign aid and educational programs in Africa, sending experts in agriculture, water management and health care.[4]During the 2000s, the foreign ministry warned that the increasing influence of the EU would further isolate Israel in global affairs.[5][6] In the wake of a series of diplomatic rifts with Turkey and the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in 2011, Israel had increasingly unfriendly relations with those countries for a few years before things improved.[7] During roughly the same period, Israeli relations with many countries in Europe including Greece and Cyprus in the context of the Energy Triangle and in Asia, including China and India, were enhanced, largely on account of the growth of Israel's high-tech economy.[8] Israeli ties with Egypt have improved since the Muslim Brotherhood was removed from power there, while ties to Turkey have been uneven since their 2010 nadir but less dismal than that point.

This cooperation is as immoral as explicit formal cooperation.Material cooperation has several inherent distinctions, the most basic being that of immediate and mediate material cooperation. Theologians maintain that in the objective order, immediate material cooperation is equivalent to implicit formal cooperation because the object of the moral act of the cooperator is indistinguishable from that of the principal agent. Those who use the term ''immediate material cooperation'' have understood this as ethically unacceptable behavior. An example of this would be any form of employment in an abortion clinic.Immediate material cooperation is contrasted with mediate cooperation. Here the moral object of the cooperator's act is not that of the wrongdoer's. (An example of this would be a health care worker employed in a secular hospital that also provides for morally prohibited procedures, but does not require the conscientious objector to such procedures to participate.) This kind of cooperation can be justified (1) for a sufficient reason and (2) if scandal can be avoided. It is a form of cooperating with the circumstances surrounding the wrongdoer's act. Depending on how closely these circumstances impinge upon the act, there is a distinction between proximate and remote material cooperation. (Proximate material cooperation would be the recovery room nurse who cares for all post-surgical patients, including those who may have undergone morally illicit procedures. This form of routine care is not intrinsically evil.)Further, necessary material cooperation is that without which the sinful act could not occur. Contingent cooperation (also called free cooperation) is that without which the evil act would still take place. An example of necessary material cooperation would be being the only anesthesiologist available to assist with a woman undergoing a combination C-section and tubal ligation. Contingent material cooperation would exist if one were not the only such professional available."106,"Demand meeting, negotiation","Yugoslavia on Tuesday demanded a meeting of the U.N.

The advantage of checking accounts is that they are highly liquid and can thus be spent easily. We will think of the demand for money as a curve that represents the outcomes of choices between the greater liquidity of money deposits and the higher interest rates that can be earned by holding a bond fund. The difference between the interest rates paid on money deposits and the interest return available from bonds is the cost of holding money.

While a shift to remote management at first may seem as if the lives of expatriates are valued over those of local staff, there is sound reasoning behind the re-allocation of risk. Firstly, locally based organizations are often linked to strong community structures and hence in a much better position to protect their staff and their interests. Secondly, harming foreign aid workers has additional incentives, an example being the increase in kidnap-for-ransom or for ""Locally based organizations are often linked to strong community structures and hence in a much better position to protect their staff and their interest"" political gains in a number of countries in recent years. Targeting local or community-based organizations does not provide the same gains. As a consequence, local organisations are generally less at risk and therefore an altogether safer option to provide assistance. However, removing well trained and experienced staff that can access funds, make high-level financial and operational decisions, and can mobilise assistance, from direct aid delivery has consequences for quality. It has been observed that the mind-set of aid workers changes when they are removed from the ‰ÛÏaction‰Ûù. They are more likely to prioritize process over results when they are not directly in touch with what the needs are on the ground. Also, if aid workers because of a remote management set-up cannot even get to understand the local environment and the operational details on the ground, they are more likely to make bad decisions or unnecessarily avoid manageable risks and hence reduce the effectiveness of their assistance. Remote management, while allowing organizations to remain engaged in crises, has therefore severe consequences for the quality of assistance."332,Express intent to provide military protection or peacekeeping,British Defence Secretary Tom King has promised to continue military aid to war-torn Mozambique. 332,Express intent to provide military protection or peacekeeping, Syria has again offered its troops to Lebanonês new President Elias Hrawi to help him oust General Michel Aoun from the Christian enclave Aoun controls. 332,Express intent to provide military protection or peacekeeping, The US Army sending more than 100 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles to South Korea to boost troop protection capabilities as tensions rise on the divided peninsula. 332,Express intent to provide military protection or peacekeeping," The Australian Prime Minister and Indonesian President have agreed to full restoration of defence cooperation, training exchanges and activities.

There is a great controversy as to whether or not censorship is a necessity in order to maintain a particular moral standard. In the case that there should be a standard, what information should people have access to? Even if there is no single answer that everyone agrees to, it is an issue that has been confronted and is being dealt with. The amount of material generated by this debate alone is huge, but the addition of the world-wide network known as the Internet only makes it grow. [9 & 10 & 11] During the past several years the Internet has expanded the abilities of the common person to gain information on a global scale. As the Internet industry grows and expands almost daily, new issues of censorship and freedom of expression are arising. [12] Issues such as the exposure of pornography to children as well as the censoring of material to students have caused enormous amounts of controversy. However, these topics are just a few of the problems with the material available over the Internet. This paper combines the issues, debates and ideas of Internet censorship from the papers of 15 individuals.

This figure exceeds the capital requirements of the oil and gas and mining industries combined. More than 40% of that $8 trillion is required to build social infrastructure in developing economies. With government finances more strained than ever, expectations for public-private partnerships (PPPs) are soaring. While private sector interest in funding public infrastructure projects has increased in recent years, barriers to private sector participation remain. Many government agencies lack the capacity and capabilities to plan, execute, and manage PPP projects. At the same time, productivity in the construction industry needs improvement. Managing these complexities can be challenging for even the most seasoned leaders. McKinsey supports all phases of project execution‰ÛÓfrom design to construction, from commissioning to ramp-up.

American identity is deeply inspired and influenced by the notion that Americans are rebels. Among the notable American dissenters include Anne Hutchinson, Nat Turner and his followers, Wovoka, and Martin Luther King Junior (Anne 56).  Anne Hutchinson was a maverick who fought tirelessly for women rights and gender equality. This made her to be regarded as a religious dissident. The Nat Turner insurrection was a slaves uprising that threatened the whites so much that they considered easing their oppression of the slaves. The insurrection inspired the oppressed to press on with their demands to be free. Wovoka was a Native American who led an organized opposition aimed liberating the Native Americans, and has their land returned to them as an assurance of eternal prosperity and peace. He claimed that the apocalypse was to return soon and destroy the White man.  He inspired his followers by way of teaching them certain rituals that were meant to appease their forefathers. In the 60s Martin Luther King Junior served as an icon of dissent (Anne 56).

The attackers, who were not affiliated with the university, were taken into custody by UC Berkeley police.Administrators decided to cancel the Wednesday event about two hours before the Breitbart editor's speech. UC Berkeley said it removed him from campus ""amid the violence and destruction of property and out of concern for public safety.""Black-clad protesters wearing masks threw commercial-grade fireworks and rocks at police. Some even hurled Molotov cocktails that ignited fires. They also smashed windows of the student union center on the Berkeley campus where the Yiannopoulos event was to be held.At least six people were injured. Some were attacked by the agitators -- who are a part of an anarchist group known as the ""Black Bloc"" that has been causing problems in Oakland for years, said Dan Mogulof, UC Berkeley spokesman.More than 1,500 protesters had gathered at Sproul Plaza, chanting and holding signs that read: ""No safe space for racists"" and ""This is war.""The violent protesters tore down metal barriers, set fires near the campus bookstore and damaged the construction site of a new dorm. One woman wearing a red Trump hat was pepper sprayed in the face while being interviewed by CNN affiliate KGO. She was able to respond that she was OK after the attack.As the scene spiraled out of control, university police warned protesters to disperse and issued a lockdown for campus buildings. Follow UC Police, Berkeley @UCPD_CalMultiple dispersal orders have been given for the Milo protest.

It will also present as the reasons for the difference in initial reaction China‰Ûªs lesser understanding of the West and the historical timing of the Western intrusion; and as the reasons for the difference in modernization Japan‰Ûªs familiarity with borrowing culturally from others, the rise of its reformist elite, and its pluralistic political system.

Customs and Excise authorities can confiscate certain goods where the proper duty has not been paid. In criminal cases, confiscation or forfeiture is now much more common than once was the case, with statutory powers being available to penalize serious criminals in a much more effective way than handing out sentences of imprisonment. So it is now possible in the UK for drug dealers to lose the houses bought with the proceeds of their trade and for the getaway car in a bank robbery to be taken and sold. There is, of course, no compensation in such cases, but there is usually a right of appeal.

"1432,Conduct strike  or boycott for policy change," Goldstein Scale. This is a widely used scale in geopolitics that maps WEIS event codes onto a number representing level of conflict or cooperation. Each CAMEO event code is assigned a numeric score from -10 to +10, capturing the theoretical potential impact that type of event will have on the stability of a country. This is known as the Goldstein Scale. This field specifies the Goldstein score for each event type. NOTE: this score is based on the type of event, not the specifics of the actual event record being recorded. Thus two riots, one with 10 people and one with 10,000, will both receive the same Goldstein score. This can be aggregated to various levels of time resolution to yield an approximation of the stability of a location over time.Average Tone. This is the average ‰ÛÏtone‰Ûù of all documents containing one or more mentions of this event. The score ranges from -100 (extremely negative) to +100 (extremely positive). Common values range between -10 and +10, with 0 indicating neutral. This can be used as a method of filtering the ‰ÛÏcontext‰Ûù of events as a subtle measure of the importance of an event and as a proxy for the ‰ÛÏimpact‰Ûù of that event. For example, a riot event with a slightly negative average tone is likely to have been a minor occurrence, whereas if it had an extremely negative average tone, it suggests a far more serious occurrence. A riot with a positive score probably suggests a very minor occurrence described in the context of a more positive narrative (such as a report of an attack occurring in a discussion of improving conditions on the ground in a country and how the number of attacks per day has been greatly reduced). To measure the emotional connotation in which the event appears, GDELT uses the tonal dictionary from Shook et al (2012). This scale goes beyond CAMEO event codes and is the measure that we use in the report."1433,Conduct strike or boycott for rights,Seven opposition parties in Nepal have organized a general strike that shut down Khatmandu in protest of last weekês arrest of a number of activists. 1433,Conduct strike or boycott for rights, More than a dozen South African politicians and several anti-apartheid activists and public figures have completed a day-long fast to draw attention to the fight of hunger-striking Palestinians protesting conditions in Israeli prisons. 1433,Conduct strike or boycott for rights," On Wednesday, March 8, women all across the United States refused to go to work in order to protest the gender pay gap.

But it also seeks to keep neutral employers from being dragged into the fray. Thus, it is unlawful for a union to coerce a neutral employer to force it to cease doing business with a primary employer.

Brian can have the union workers go out on strike. A strike occurs when workers stop work in order to pressure the company to make a bargaining concession. The idea is to hurt the company where it counts - in the company coffers. Stopping work costs money because the company will still have overhead and fixed expenses. It also often results in loss of profits.Strikes come in two general flavors: economic strikes and unfair labor practice strikes. An economic strike is about trying to win some economic benefit for employees, such as a raise in wages. An unfair labor practice strike is a strike undertaken when an employer has violated a labor relations law.

This figure exceeds the capital requirements of the oil and gas and mining industries combined. More than 40% of that $8 trillion is required to build social infrastructure in developing economies. With government finances more strained than ever, expectations for public-private partnerships (PPPs) are soaring. While private sector interest in funding public infrastructure projects has increased in recent years, barriers to private sector participation remain. Many government agencies lack the capacity and capabilities to plan, execute, and manage PPP projects. At the same time, productivity in the construction industry needs improvement. Managing these complexities can be challenging for even the most seasoned leaders. McKinsey supports all phases of project execution‰ÛÓfrom design to construction, from commissioning to ramp-up.

Although words alone are insufficient, they might create an assault when coupled with some action that indicates the ability to carry out the threat. A mere threat to harm is not an assault; however, a threat combined with a raised fist might be sufficient if it causes a reasonable apprehension of harm in the victim.Intent is an essential element of assault. In tort law, it can be specific intent‰ÛÓif the assailant intends to cause the apprehension of harmful or offensive contact in the victim‰ÛÓor general intent‰ÛÓif he or she intends to do the act that causes such apprehension. In addition, the intent element is satisfied if it is substantially certain, to a reasonable person, that the act will cause the result. A defendant who holds a gun to a victim's head possesses the requisite intent, since it is substantially certain that this act will produce an apprehension in the victim. In all cases, intent to kill or harm is irrelevant.In criminal law, the attempted battery type of assault requires a Specific Intent to commit battery. An intent to frighten will not suffice for this form of assault.There can be no assault if the act does not produce a true apprehension of harm in the victim. There must be a reasonable fear of injury. The usual test applied is whether the act would induce such apprehension in the mind of a reasonable person. The status of the victim is taken into account. A threat made to a child might be sufficient to constitute an assault, while an identical threat made to an adult might not.Virtually all jurisdictions agree that the victim must be aware of the danger. This element is not required, however, for the attempted battery type of assault. A defendant who throws a rock at a sleeping victim can only be guilty of the attempted battery assault, since the victim would not be aware of the possible harm."183,"Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing","Irish nationalist guerrillas wounded two British soldiers in a bomb attack on Thursday, police said.

"72,Provide military aid," Military aid can be controversial. Its stated aim is usually to help allies or poor countries fight terrorism, counter-insurgencies or to help fight drug wars.The aid may be in the form of training, or even giving credits for foreign militaries to purchase weapons and equipment from the donor country.It is argued that strengthening military relationships can strengthen relationships between nations and military aid may be a way to achieve that. Where the two nations are democracies, it is believed such relationships can be strengthened even further when the militaries of the respective nations are fully behind the principles of democracy.But military aid may even be given to opposition groups to fight nations. This could be understandable if the opposition is a potential democratic force standing up against authoritarian rule.However, as was especially seen during the Cold War, democratic nations (or potentially emerging democratic fledgling nations) often found themselves fighting foreign supported undemocratic forces because of geopolitical goals of the superpowers who tolerated or supported such regimes and dictatorships in order to achieve their own geopolitical aims.

Foreign aid has been given to a variety of recipients, including developing countries, countries of strategic importance to the United States, and countries recovering from war. The government channels about half of its economic assistance through a specialized agency, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Government-sponsored foreign aid began a systematic fashion after World War II, with the Marshall Plan of 1948 and the Mutual Security Act of 1951-61. It has been politically highly charged, as most Americans believe the amount of aid given is much higher than the amount stated by the government.[1] In the 21st century, the US government operates five major categories of foreign assistance: bilateral development aid (the largest amount), economic assistance supporting U.S. political and security goals, humanitarian aid, multilateral economic contributions, and military aid "70,Provide aid, WHO is teaming up with the Red-cross in providing food and medical supplies to residence of Aleppo. 70,Provide aid, In the wake of widespread flooding the British government is providing aid to Bangladesh.1043,Demand rights,"The main Hutu rebel group, Forces for Defence of Democracy (FDD), insistedon its demands that Burundiês government grant the Hutu majoritymore rights."1043,Demand rights,Women in Saudi Arabia drive as means of protesting the oppressive regime.1043,Demand rights, The Women's March across the world demanding rights from their governments.1043,Demand rights,  1043,Demand rights," Este sabado 24 de junio, CNDH acompaÌ±arÌÁ marcha del orgullo gay en Mexico, mediante diferentes actividades a lo largo y ancho del pais latinoamericano.

This article describes the history of the energyregime complex as it has changed over the past 40 years, and interprets this historyin light of an interpretive framework of the sources of institutional change. One of itsprincipal contributions is to highlight what Stephen Krasner referred to as a pattern of‰ÛÏpunctuated equilibrium‰Ûù reflecting both periods of stasis and periods of innovation,as opposed to a gradual process of change. We show that the timing of innovationdepends on dissatisfaction and shocks and that the nature of innovation‰ÛÓthat is,whether it is path-dependent or de novo‰ÛÓdepends on interest homogeneity amongmajor actors. This paper is the first to demonstrate the empirical applicability of thepunctuated equilibrium concept to international regime complexes, and contributesto the eventual development of a dynamic theory of change in regime complexes.Keywords Regime complex .

"831,Accede to demands for change in leadership," Glenn Llopis ,   CONTRIBUTORI solve the leadership identity crisis to enable opportunities.  Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.Change management is in full-force across all industries, yet many leaders are unprepared to act upon and operationalize the requirements for change to avoid business disruption. For many organizations, preparedness begins at the top and this means that leadership ‰ÛÒ across all levels ‰ÛÒ must have absolute clarity in purpose and focus; there also must be alignment in strategic philosophy and resolution goals.Unfortunately, many organizations are slow to change as the internal politics makes it difficult to reach consensus across all levels of leadership ‰ÛÒ even when the necessity for change is urgent. This is why many companies unknowingly lose momentum as they fail to change fast enough -- allowing the marketplace and competitors to pass them by.  The result: valuable time is misspent, resources applied and money invested without the required outcomes to stay competitive, keep clients satisfied and employees engaged.Change-ManagementHaving led several change management strategies throughout my career, it is imperative that an organization‰Ûªs leaders have clarity and are in alignment with their responses to the following questions (as a result of their change management efforts):What does success look like operationally and financially ‰ÛÒ and how does this benefit our employees and customers?What is our mission trying to solve for the industry we serve  and how can we improve our ability to accomplish more than in the past ‰ÛÒ  so that the organization  can remain competitive, become more profitable and/or achieve market leadership?What resources and relationships are mandatory to accomplish our goals, achieve sustainable success and be significant in our industry?It‰Ûªs easy for leaders to say that they need to improve and invest in doing things better (either because the marketplace is telling them to or because they need to be proactive before circumstances force their hand).  The reality is that without strategy, change is merely substitution ‰ÛÒ not evolution.  Simply put, you can have an idea, but without the right strategy and execution of the idea, very little if any progress will be made.  When leaders fall into this trap, they are being irresponsible and their credibility suffers, their intentions come into question, and doubt begins to loom about their capabilities and know-how."834,"Accede to demands for change in institutions, regime",President Dos Sontas has reportedly conceded at last to demands from National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to overhaul the judiciary. 834,"Accede to demands for change in institutions, regime", Lt.

They‰Ûªve seen snippets of demonstrations on TV, but they don‰Ûªt really know how it works.In contrast to the larger crowd, there is always a small, core group of people who are very familiar with the mechanics of demonstrations and marches, who have arrived as a group with the intention of taking control and guiding the demonstration in what they feel is the appropriate direction. They bring bullhorns, drums, whistles, and large signs. They bring a certain level of skill at organizing demonstrations and they use their bullhorns to coach the crowd on chants and callback responses, and to outline a plan of action and describe the objectives of the march. They bring rhetoric, slogans and fiery speeches about justice and popular defiance which they have no doubt delivered many times before.

"871,"Declare truce, ceasefire"," During World War I, Turkey, which was an ally of Germany, had its troops stationed both in the Balkan States in the west and at the Russian-Iranian border in the north and east. The Russian army was holding its positions against Turkey in the Caucasus mountains on the north and at the Turkish-Iranian border on the east, but when the Russian army withdrew from the war zone in this area due to Lenin's Revolution, its army stationed in the Caucasus was no longer there to protect the Assyrian and Armenian minorities. The Turkish government, who were angry at the Christians, had been kept under pressure by the Russian Army. In the absence of Russian power in the area, however, the Turkish Army, under the leadership of General Mustafa Kemal Pasha, who later was named Kemal AtatÌ_rk, and his close associate Enver Pasha, had some time to reconsolidate their positions on the two eastern borders.In the meantime, the Kurdish bandit Simko Shikak, also considered by his people to be their leader, was secretly working with both the Turkish and Iranian governments for the annihilation of the Assyrians. Simko's hope was that by annihilating the Assyrians he would get an autonomous rule for his people, who lived in both Turkey and Iran. Simko requested a summit meeting for peace with His Beatitude Mar Benyamin Shimun, who was at the time both top religious leader of the Assyrian Church of the East and political leader of the Assyrians. Mar Shimun accepted Simko's invitation for a peace mission, and took on March 3, 1918, an entourage after approximately 150 well armed men with him, because Simko was known to be untrustworthy. As the carriage carrying Mar Shimon reached Simko headquarters, he was graciously greeted by Simko's guards. As Mar Shimon approached the interior of Simko's inner quarters, the Kurdish leader received him with all honour. The two leaders' discussions were most amicable. One of Mar Shimon's men had observed the shadows of some men on the very large roof of the headquarters, not realizing that there were actually several hundred of Simko's armed men hiding on the rooftop and all around the buildings. Simko later escorted Mar Shimun to the gate, kissed his hand, and his horsemen were ready to conduct him on his way. No sooner had Mar Shimon and his entouroge stepped outside of the yard, than a barrage of gunfire opened simultaneously from all directions, killing the religious leader and about 140 of his men. Of the ten men who escaped, 6 were wounded."1242,Refuse to ease popular dissent,"Around 1,800 of 2,200 Serbian teachers will not end their strike unless their demands for wage increases are met by Belgrade, a union official announced after three weeks of striking.

"356,Express intent to de-escalate military engagement," The United Nations are coming together to suppress North Korea's military engagement and training, and especially the testing of Missiles. "356,Express intent to de-escalate military engagement," For military ways and means to help attain a political end, the military itself must possess the capability to help transform an environment of conflict into an atmosphere of political, social, and economic stability. In short, a modern military must have the ability to escalate and de-escalate the level of violence as appropriate to coerce or persuade people, political parties, insurgents, guerrillas, or any other actor involved to return to the conditions necessary to resolve the conflict. The outdated conceptual split between traditional major combat operations and nontraditional ""nation building"" has not only hindered performance at every level of operations, but has potentially turned initial tactical advantages into strategic failures. To properly bridge the gap between traditional and nontraditional operations and help operational commanders develop appropriate ways to reach political ends, three supporting concepts must be explored. First, the concept of military contact, which is aimed at gaining insight into how both persuasion and coercion are important, while understanding that for a long-term solution, the ability to persuade is far more significant. Second, the concept that it is the operational level of war in which the strategic ends and tactical means are reconciled helps demonstrate the overwhelming need for commanders to create clear intent and Rules of Engagement (ROE). Third is the concept that successful decision making must be based on suitable lenses or filters created by training, commander's intent, and ROE, which in turn help to create the appropriate understanding of the situation within military members at the tactical level.

Statutes generally confer rights of inheritance only on blood relatives, adopted children, adoptive parents, and the surviving spouse. Line of descent is the order or series of persons who have descended one from the other or all from a common ancestor, placed in a line in the order of their birth showing the connection of all blood relatives. The direct line of descent involves persons who are directly descended from the same ancestor, such as father and son, or grandfather and grandson. Whether an adopted child can be regarded as in the direct line of descent depends upon the law in the particular jurisdiction. The collateral line of descent involves persons who are descended from a common ancestor, such as brothers who share the same father or cousins who have the same grandfather. Title by descent differs from title by purchase because descent involves the operation of law, while purchase involves the act or agreement of the parties. Usually direct descendants have first preference in the order of succession, followed by ascendants (persons in the collateral line of ascent), and finally, collateral heirs. Each generation is called a degree in determining the consanguinity, "353,Express intent to release persons or property, Singapore is willing to release recently imprisoned US citizens at the behest of the US government 353,Express intent to release persons or property," North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has stated North Korea will release all American prisoners if sanctions against North Korea are lifted.

See Art. II, å_1, cl. 2. When questions arise about the meaning of state laws, including election laws, it is our settled practice to accept the opinions of the highest courts of the States as providing the final answers. On rare occasions, however, either federal statutes or the Federal Constitution may require federal judicial intervention in state elections. This is not such an occasion.    The federal questions that ultimately emerged in this case are not substantial. Article II provides that ‰ÛÏ[e]ach State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors.‰Ûù Ibid. (emphasis added). It does not create state legislatures out of whole cloth, but rather takes them as they come‰ÛÒas creatures born of, and constrained by, their state constitutions.

The POLHIA research project is supporting this effort with in-depth analysis of the financial crisis and concrete recommendations for European policy makers. While parts of the research are quite technical, the project has succeeded in producing a series of documents that are accessible to the non-specialist and provide fascinating insights into the roots of the crisis. Moreover, the researchers have proposed a series of policy measures which they feel could be instrumental in preventing a similar crisis in the long run.In addition to arguing for an overhaul of the way forecasting methodologies are applied (particularly with respect to monetary policy), the researchers offer a three-pronged policy prescription to avoid future macroeconomic problems:Support for a more robust social protection system in the developing world.An end to ‰Û÷destructive‰Ûª social and fiscal competition among countries (both within Europe and on a global scale).More mutually beneficial cooperation among countries.These recommendations - together with a thought-provoking analysis of what caused the crisis - are found in a policy brief entitled ‰Û÷The Structural Roots of the Crisis and the Way Out: Mitigating Inequality and Rethinking Global Governance‰Ûª1. As the title suggests, the crisis is described as having a structural root - and that root is income inequality.Looking back over the decades leading up to the crisis, the researchers identified a potential reduction of demand for goods and services, which they say was caused by a massive structural change in income and wealth distribution. Jean-Paul Fitoussi, the POLHIA team member who authored this part of the study, notes that during the past 30 years the median wage in most advanced countries has stagnated or declined. Inequalities have surged in favour of high incomes, he observes, resulting in weak global demand."3101,"Express intent to build political infrastructure, not specified",HowAshraf Ghani Can Build a Powerful Political Machine3101,"Express intent to build political infrastructure, not specified", President Juan Carlos Varela expresses intent to improve the economic and political structure within Peru; critics remain concerned 3101,"Express intent to build political infrastructure, not specified", the president in his address reaffirmed that is government is ready to kick start the oil refinery project 3101,"Express intent to build political infrastructure, not specified", British government leaders have announced their plan to strengthen the economic network protecting political donations in order to broaden the amount of financial supporters taking part in the political process.55,Apologize,"Argentina has apologized to Brazil for one of its gunboats intercepting aBrazilian ship in the Beagle Channel, disputed by Argentina and Chile.

Recognition can be accorded either de facto or de jure. Recognition can be a declaration to that effect by the recognizing government, or an act of recognition such as entering into a treaty with the other state. A vote by a country in the United Nations in favour of the membership of another country is an implicit recognition of that country by the country so voting, as only states may be members of the UN.The non-recognition of particular acts of a state does not normally effect the recognition of the state itself. For example, the international rejection of the occupation of particular territory by a recognised state does not imply non-recognition of the state itself, nor a rejection of a change of government by illegal means.

Writing in 1861, the influential British philosopher and economist, John Stuart Mill stated in Utilitarianism his view that ""Society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it, that is, who have deserved equally well absolutely.

Real-world events and attempts to improve the development of theory ledscholars to address questions of when, why and how states restructure and reorienttheir foreign policies. The study of foreign policy change is an important endeavor.Significant foreign policy changes can be disruptive to the international system, withramifications felt throughout the world. The study of foreign policy change alsoprovides unique opportunities to examine the dynamics of the foreign policy decisionmakingprocess and those factors that influence and constrain it.The bulk of scholarly work in the area of foreign policy change has consistedlargely of theoretical frameworks, single case studies, or studies of particular groupsof countries. Notably lacking are major empirical studies that cast explanatoryvariables across time and space, providing results that can be generalized acrossmultiple cases.
